## Abstract

"Human resource management (HRM) draws on the field of organizational theory (OT) to identify, quantify, and manage people-based phenomena that impact organizational operations and outcomes. OT research has long used computational methods and agent-based modeling to understand complex adaptive systems. Agent-based modeling methodologies within HRM, however, are still rare. Within the HRM and management science literature, Herzberg’s et al. (1959) Two-Factor Theory (TFT) is a framework that has been tested and used for decades. Its ability to capture the interaction between a work force’s motivation and their environment’s hygiene lends itself well to agent-based modeling as a method of study. Here, we present the development of the Human Resources Management-Parameter Experimentation Tool (HRM-PET) as the first explicit ABM instantiation of TFT, filling the gap between the study of HRM and computational OT tools like agent-based modeling."
